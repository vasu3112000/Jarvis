# Jarvis
Jarvis is my very own personal assistant which helps me do some useful tasks like sending an e-mail, watching a youtube video, searching wikipedia for information opening google , playing music etc.

# Installation
Download the complete folder and save it anywhere in your desktop. Open the file named Jarvis.py in a any python IDE such as pycharm, anaconda etc.

Install pyttsx3, datetime, speech recognition, wikipedia, webbrowser, os, smtplib libraries in your interpreter if they are not present. Once installed, you're ready to use the software.

Once you run the code your personal assistant will greet you and you are ready to give it the tasks. Just speak what you want the assistant to do and you will get the results. It will keep on taking your commands till you say bye or quit and the assistant will stop.

# Code Explanation
There are multiple functions in the code
* Speak Function :- This function enables the assistant to speak. All the things which our assistant speaks will be through this function only.
